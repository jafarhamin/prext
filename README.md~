A Time Bound Verification Tool

# Contents 

This repository contains Prext-v, a verification tool written in OCaml to verify execution time bounds of programs compilied by prext-c and executed on the microcontroller MSP430f5510, and Prext-c, a non-optimizing compiler and assembler for the microcontroller MSP430f5510 written in OCaml that produces machine code with a predictable execution time where the number of cycles to execute the target code can be specified from the high-level source code.
